 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: hsbdemo.csv, perform classification using the KNN supervised
 learning algorithm with K=5 and test_size=0.10. Print the accuracy of the model as well as the
 visual confusion matrix. Additionally, print the labels of the misclassified data points (predicted
 vs actual). For features (i.e., predictor variables), use all columns apart from columns: id, prog
 and cid. For the target variable (i.e., y or response variable) use column prog.

 Exercise 2:
 Given the following dataset: hsbdemo.csv, apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 unsupervised learning algorithm. Print the variance ratio and plot the cumulative sum of the
 variance ratio for all 10 features, as shown in Fig. 1 below. Use the same columns for X and y as
 in Exercise 1.
